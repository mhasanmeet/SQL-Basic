## SQL
SQL stands for Structured Query Language, use in Relational Based Database like MySQL, SQL Server, Oracle, Postgres and others. 

## What SQL can do?

* SQL can execute queries against a database
* SQL can retrieve data, insert, Update, Delete, Create Data to Database, also can create new Database, create table and delete table in Database and many more

Though SQL major commands like `SELECT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `INSERT`, `WHERE` is same in all Relational Database system like in MySQL, Oracle, Postgres but almost all have their own different commands and extensions. 

## SQL Command Types
SQL have 4 types of command or language, together they build SQL. They're

1. Data Definition Language, in here the commands have

* Create
* Alter
* Drop
* Rename
* Insert
* Update
* Delete
* Merge
* Truncate

2. Data Control Language, in here the commands have

* Grant
* Revoke

3. Data Query Language, in here the commands have

* Select

4. Data Manipulation Language, in here the commands have

## Database Table Key's
There three different types of DataBase Key have, they're

* Primary Key
In a Relational DB table Primary Key is key identification and unique data in a table.  

* Foreign Key
Foreign is a unique identification and unique data between two or more table. 

* Composite Key 
Composite key is a key build with two column. 

## Common SQL Data types

* INT - Integer is a Numeric Data Types. INT have maximum values of 2147483647, so you can not put value more than this. Like 5502374473 is not accepted value for int and give us an error. for nid or phone better practice is to use String VARCHAR datatype.

* DECIMAL(10,4) - Decimal is a Numeric Data Types. Here (10,4) means there may 10 total decimal numbers and 4 have after decimal numbers, like `1092827289.0000`

* VARCHAR(5) - VARCHAR is a String Data Types. VARCHAR means variable character, Here It (5) means it can store max 5 characters

* BLOB - BLOB is a String Data Types. BLOB means Binary Large Object, Store Images or big objects

* DATE - Date is a datetime data type. Date data type structure 'YYYY-MM-DD'

* TIMESTAMP - TimeStamp is a datetime data type. It's structure is - 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'

* TEXT - Text is a String Data Types. Text is for text, where we can store only text character.

## SQL Data Rule Methods
SQL Data Rule Method also called constrains.

* NOT NULL
* NULL
* UNIQUE
* DESC
* ASC
* CHECK 
* DEFAULT
* AUTO_INCREMENT
* REFERENCES

## sql wildcards
